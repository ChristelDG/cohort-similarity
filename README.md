Our original health dataset is based on the AP-HP data wharehouse.

The preliminary NER-step is done with the nlstruct algorithm : https://github.com/percevalw/nlstruct

An interactive heatmap corresponding to our similarity cohort computation can be found at this link : http://xavier.tannier.free.fr/misc/patient_similarity/demo.html
